A Day in the Life of a Remote Developer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeOeCoKUt3A

Here's it is! Another day in the life a remote developer, youtuber and director of women who code. Hang out with me as I discuss work, talk a bit about diversity, go to women who code meetups and ultimately show you how I work as a developer, youtuber and director of women who code.

Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoy the video!

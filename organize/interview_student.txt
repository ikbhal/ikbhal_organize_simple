How many of us face the 
problem of comparison with 
neighbours' children...?


Even if the parents are quite, 
relatives will come enquiring...

how many marks your child got in 
10 th exams...

If the child has got fewer marks,
then parents feel ashamed to 
tell the marks

on top of that they will tell 
the marks of all the others 
who have got more marks

The parents feel even worse
and the child then receive more scholding...

This is the main reason why the children 
commit suicide
---
We cant step out of the house...
If we fail in the 10th grade

We will be made to feel ashamed to 
even walk in the street

That is the reason many commit suicide...

Neighbours too gossip about the better 
marks their children have score with my mother

My mother feels bad and starts scolding and beating me...

Parents and relatives are the main reason for suicides

Suppose your father wants you to do a degree course...

But you dont want to study after 10th grade

Then what would you do?

Will you convince them? Or will you do what they want?

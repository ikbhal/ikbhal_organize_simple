KotlinConf 2018 - I Am a Developer at 54 by Alicia Carr
Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs
I talk about how and why I wanted to be an iOS mobile developer at the age of 51. How a 16 year inspired me to learn to code and the challenges I face after becoming an iOS developer being the first self-taught African American woman mobile developer to create a domestic violence app dedicated to helping victims escape abuse and how Apple found me and was highlight at WWDC 2015, 2016 keynote event and I am a developer video. Some people want to believe that people my age are out of touch with technology and as a woman.

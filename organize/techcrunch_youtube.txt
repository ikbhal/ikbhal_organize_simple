We provide AI-based computer vision solutions to power next generation robotics and smart systems for the waste management industry
---
Smart Bins
Smart bins and reverse vending machines can embed object recognition to accept recyclables, reject contaminants and classify (sort) the waste automatically. This allows for more advanced decentralised systems for waste management. 
---
Waste Monitoring
We can monitor waste composition at different stages of the waste life cycle in bins, trucks, and sorting facilities, and thereby provide actionable data insights and transparency to businesses generating large amounts of waste. This enables efficient tracking and direction of waste flows, as well as providing data for targeted education and incentive schemes to increase recycling rates. 
---
Automated Sorting
Our computer vision software can power robots that identify and rapidly pick objects off a conveyor belt in Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs) to remove impurities. This automates an unpleasant manual task and can provide data on purity levels of sorted materials for recycling.

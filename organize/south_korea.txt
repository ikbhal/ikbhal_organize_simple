Main article: Conscription in South Korea
South Korea has mandatory military service of 21 (army, marines), 23 (navy) and 24 (air force, special civil service) months. There are no alternatives for conscientious objectors except imprisonment.[90] In general, with very few exceptions, most South Korean males serve in the military. The duration of service varies from branch to branch of the military. There is an expectation of reducing the duration of military service by June 2020 to 18 months for Army and Marines, 20 months for Navy, 22 months for Air Force, 21 months for Social Service, and a maximum special Social Service period for 3 years.[citation needed]

Exemptions are granted to Korean male citizens with physical disabilities or whose mental status is unstable or questionable. When a Korean man becomes of legal age, he is required to take a physical check-up to determine whether he is suitable for military service. Any Korean male athlete who has won a medal in the Olympic Games or a gold in the Asian Games is also spared from the obligation.

Grades 1â€“3: normal
Grade 4: special service; given to individuals that fulfil their military duties as a civil worker amongst civilians.
Grade 5: civil defence during peacetime.
Grade 6: exemption from military service in both situation.
Grade 7: re-check-up within two years.
There are some controversies portrayed in Korean media concerning special treatment given to celebrities. In 2002 Yoo Seung-jun, a Korean pop singer, became a naturalized American citizen to avoid his military duty in Korea. For this reason, Korea has banned Yoo from the country and actually deported him.[91] Another recent example is MC Mong, a popular singer/rapper accused of avoiding his military service by having his molar teeth removed. On 11 April 2011, MC Mong was sentenced to a suspended jail term of 6 months, probation for one year, and 120 hours of community service.[92]

Greetings, my name is Tiffany! I am a backend web application engineer at Musicbed. I work primarily in PHP, Laravel and MySQL and am loving the journey of learning, contributing to making a better product and working with a great team.
I first learned about code back in 2009 but didn’t really understand the entire tech field at the time. Later on, I decided to join a coding bootcamp called Coding Dojo, to improve my tech skills - It definitely was the best decision for me! It was a long journey and I started documenting my journey via youtube.
In 2018, I joined Women Who Code DFW as the Director of Digital Media - Documenting our meetup talks and taking photos. I manage their youtube channel (Women Who Code DFW Youtube Channel).
I’d love to hear from you - Watch my Youtube videos? don’t be afraid to comment below any of my vids, I write back as soon as I can and am happy to help and answer any questions you have. Want to collaborate on a Youtube Video? I’d love to hear your story and so many others need to hear it, reach out to me via any of these sources.

Ramana 7ths std

Till 6th Std I studied in Dubai...
There we had homework in all 5 subjects
daily like in Maths, Social Science
etc

If I was not able to do it,
my mother used to do my home work..

Sometimes till 1am and even 2am
my mother would keep doing it...

It used to be a strain on my mother


I hae got slapped by my teacher...

She used to hold my cheeks and beat me

She used to pinch my cheeks like this

She used to turn my ears like this

She used to make us kneel down outside the class in the sun.

In my previous school I used to get headaches often


The teachers used to keep on pushing me to study all the time

Even  if we turned and looked away
we were beaten with the scale
---
I like the fact that there are no exames here

In my previous school in the name of the exams  they used to keep on pestering us

We had to do the worksheets from all the text books

---
For every term this worksheets need to be completed...

If we did not do even one question
we were punished

Once a body was beaten with a 
bamboo stick

For exams many children will hide bits of paper on which they would have writtern the answers

Even I have carried bits with me...

here in my collar...

Because it was the final exam, so I was afraid to fail

If we fail we will have to kneel 
on the chair


They used to put some glass pieces on 
the chair before making us kneel down

That is why I copied, otherwise I 
would not have copied

They are interested in money

Please do not compare with others

Vishnu - 6th std
Because it is easier to do MUG up
---
If we understand something and do it..
There is no chance of us forgetting the concepts

---
if fail , what other doing
 wrong thing
 is it correct
 suicide

 if you are feel to do it
---
what would be the state our mind?

we would have hoped for something and now it would be beyond our reach

so we would be very sad

In such a condition would we
come to the same conclusion of ending our lives?

So however big problem is
we will not die aunty

none of you would make the decision to end your lives... is it?

Suresh 8th std
I will not die if I fail

Why should I sacrifice my life 
for just an exam?

What if failed in one test?
